<div class=subtitles>Ocean model:</div>
<br>
A working configuration is needed, i.e., the model compiled, grid, initial conditions, text
input file (roms.in).

<p>

Model may will run with several types of forcings. Tides, if used, are
usually fixed for at least one year. Surface atmospheric data has usually have high
frequency and is stored locally (this can be easily changed). Lateral data can be
a fixed climatology) or can change regularly. OOF&epsilon; includes a module to
get data from HYCOM data server and create boundary clm and bry files (other sources can
be used).

<p><br>
<div class=subtitles>Python software:</div>
<br>
- Python (&ge;2.6) <br>
- Matplotlib (with Basemap toolkit)<br>
- Numpy<br>
- NetCDF4-Python<br>
- Pygrib (if surface forcing data in grib format will be used)<br>
- Okean

<p>
There are a few Python distributions which include all these tools (except Pygrib and Okean).
You may try <a href='http://continuum.io' target='_blank'>ANACONDA</a> (totally free,
recommended) or <a href='http://www.enthought.com' target='_blank'>Enthought</a>. You can also easily
install everything by hand or from repositories.
<p>
Okean is my collection of Python tools for ocean modelling. Is the base of OOF&epsilon;.
You can get it from this site here: <a href='../okean/download.php'>OKEAN &gt; downloads</a>.
