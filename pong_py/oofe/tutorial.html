check_oof.py is used with crontab to check/start operational system. Folder log
includes logs of the tasks done. A new log starts every time operational system stops (ie, when there is some problem). Folder oof includes all model input/output and the python engine.
run_a.py and run_f.py start the analysis and forecast engines. They are called by check_oof.py.
The configuration file setup.py includes several options and paths to files. See next step.

grdFile  = 'PATH TO FILE *** EDIT ***'
iniFile  = 'PATH TO FILE *** EDIT ***'
iniDate  = 'YYYYMMDD     *** EDIT ***'

Edit here the fixed file names. grdFile - grid; iniFile - initial conditions; clmFile -
climatology; fltFile - floats input file; staFile - stations input file; frcFile - any
fixed forcing file, like climatological rivers, tides...; runFileA and runFileF - ocean model
for analysis and forecast. atmPath is the place where local atmospheric data is stored
(not required for now, needed if you will use GFS data; you will find more information
about this in point 4). Set False the files/paths you dont want to link at this step.
iniDate is the date corresponding to iniFile (ex. iniDate = '20130101'). grdFile, iniFile, iniDate, runFileA and runFileF are required!

<div class=subtitles>4. about lateral forcing</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
The operation system includes a module to deal with the creation of clm and bry
files from the HYCOM opendap server. This module, get_hycom.py is located in
op/oof/aux/apptools. The variables sparams and obc must be edited in the file. sparams
are the vertical coordinate parameters: theta_s, theta_b, hc, nLevels, Vtransform, Vstretching.
obc are the open boundaries, ex: 'nsw'. It is used in the creation of the bry files.

<br>
When using the global HYCOM dataset, finding the region to extract may take some time.
So, the first time the modules is used, a file with indices is created (ijinds.pickle) in the same folder.

<div class=subtitles>5. test the creation of lateral forcing</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
Better test everything before the operational system starts producing errors of all kind...
So, let's open ipython and try to create clm+bry files for some day.
<div class=bash>
[user@ ~/op]$ cd oof
[user@ ~op/oof]$ ipython
In [1]: from engine import oof
In [2]: oof.gen_clmbry(date='20130101',FA='a',cf='oof.conf',quiet=False)
</div>
<br>
If all goes well, the name of the files created will be returned with an empty error message.
Otherwise, better not continue until the problem is not solved.

<br>
gem_clmbry has as main inputs the date (can be a YYYYMMDD string of a datetime); FA='a'|'f',
analysis or forecast; the engine configuration file (we will check it in a next step) and
a quiet flag. The analysis files have one day of data, from 00h of YYYYMMDD to 00h of next day.
The forecast files may have more days. You can change the number of forecast days in the
configuration file oof.conf (search for npred, npred = 5 by default).

make some plots of the clm file created to check all is ok (make life easy and use the
Okean ROMS gui: rgui GRD CLM)
</div>
<p>


<a name='item6'></a>
[<a href='#top'>top</a>]
<div class=subtitles>6. about surface forcing</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
The operation system includes tools to deal with many atmospheric datasets: INTERIM, NARR,
WRF local model outputs, CFSR and GFS. From these, only GFS has global forecasts with good
resolution and periodicity (0.5&deg; every 3 h). By default, OOF&epsilon; uses GFS, which should
be stored locally (in grib format).
<p>

It is now possible to get GFS data automatically from nomads opendap server but seems to be
slower and not with the same availability as data in the http server. Besides maybe is a
good idea to keep original data. Global GFS variables required for the model are about 2Mb
each time, ie, less than 100M needed per day, including 5 days forecast.
<p>

To download GFS you can create a script (and call it regularly from crontab) with this
information:
<div class=bash>
from sys import argv
from okean.datasets import gfs

BaseFolder='/home/user/op_data/gfs_3h_0.5'
quiet=True
date=False # will get last seven days including today's forecast

try: date=argv[1]
except: pass

try: quiet=argv[2]=='1'
except: pass

q=gfs.GFSDownload(basefolder=BaseFolder)
q.download_current(quiet=quiet,date=date)
</div>
<p>~
To deal with grib files, python needs pygrib. To install it you also need grib api.
If it is not installed in standard locations, you may need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
in crontab to the lib folder of the grib api installation.
<p>

BaseFolder must include the configuration file tags.info. This file sets the data server,
filenames, number of forecast days, etc. These files for GFS 1&deg; and GFS 0.5&deg; can
be obtained here: <a href='tags.info_1'>1&deg;</a>, <a href='tags.info_0.5'>0.5&deg;</a>.
<p>

It also must contain a folder scripts and a folder log (a log file will be stored here).
In folder scripts you should put the two scripts available in the site~
http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/txt_descriptions/fast_downloading_grib.shtml, where the
"fast downloading of GRIB2 Files from the NCEP NOMAD Server" is described (cURL must be
installed).

You will end up with the following structure (inside BaseFolder ~/op_data/gfs_3h_0.5):
<div class=bash>
   download_gfs.py
   tags.info
   |--gribs
   |----20120801
   |----20120802
        ...
   |----20131026

        gfs_20131026_00_09.grib2
        gfs_20131026_00_102.grib2
        gfs_20131026_00_105.grib2

      download.log
   |--scripts
      get_grib.pl
      get_inv.pl
</div>
<p>
In point 1, atmPath is actually the BaseFoder. So if you want to use GFS data and didn't set
atmPath in file setup.py, you can go to folder external of oof and link GFS data there:
<div class=bash>
[user@ ~/op/oof]$ cd ~/op/oof/external
[user@ ~/op/oof/external] ln -s ~/op_data/gfs_3h_0.5 atm
</div>
</div>
<p>


<a name='item7'></a>
[<a href='#top'>top</a>]
<div class=subtitles>7. test the creation of surface forcing</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
It is assumed that you have atmospheric data stored locally from GFS, in grib format,
and the GFS folder is linked as ~op/oof/external/atm.

<div class=bash>
[user@ ~/op/oof/external]$ cd ~/op/oof~
[user@ ~op/oof]$ ipython
In [1]: from engine import oof
In [2]: oof.gen_atmfrc(date='20130101',FA='a',cf='oof.conf',quiet=False)
</div>
<p>

if all goest well, a bulk forcing file is created in folder ~/op/oof/inputs/blk, and the
filename with path is returned.
</div>
<p>


<a name='item8'></a>
[<a href='#top'>top</a>]
<div class=subtitles>8. other forcings</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
You can set path for fixed forcing files in model input text file. Variable forcing data must
be managed by the system, like lateral and surface forcing. Other possible variable data is the
river discharge. If you want to use rivers go to oofe configuration file, ~/op/oof/oof.conf
and set riverfrc=True. Then you must edit the river forcing generation sample script,
~/op/oof/aux/apptools/get_river.py. Anything other operational task can be added to oofe main
file, ~/op/oof/engine/oof.py...
</div>
<p>


<a name='item9'></a>
[<a href='#top'>top</a>]
<div class=subtitles>9. about model input parameters files</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
Every time model runs, it uses a new standard input parameters file, updated with new input/output
file names. Files are created from one initial with tags that will be replaced. So, you must have
one initial file for analysis and other for forecast (by default they only differ in NTIMES)
in folder ~/op/oof/inputs/roms_in/. There you will find already the two files, ocean_a_n0.in
and ocean_f_n0.in.
<p>
They may not correspond to your version, so you may need to use your own
file ocean.in to replace these two files. If so, mv ocean.in ocean_a.in, then edit ocean_a.in
by changing the value of several variables by #&lt;VAR&gt;#, example: TITLE = #TITLE#.
All the replacements to do are:

<pre>
TITLE = #TITLE# (then set title in oof.conf)
MyAppCPP = #APPCPP# (then set appcpp in oof.conf)
NtileI == #NTILEI# (then set ntile_i in oof.conf)
NtileJ == #NTILEJ# (then set ntile_j in oof.conf)
DSTART =  #DSTART#.0d0~
GRDNAME == #GRD#
ININAME == #INI#
BRYNAME == #BRY#
CLMNAME == #CLM#
FRCNAME == #FRC# \  (or just FRCNAME == #BLK#, if only bulk forcing will be used)
           #BLK#
RSTNAME == #RST#
HISNAME == #HIS#
AVGNAME == #AVG#
STANAME == #STA#
FLTNAME == #FLT#
SPOSNAM =  #STA_IN#
FPOSNAM =  #FLT_IN#
</pre>

The file names will be generated according to rules in oof.conf. You may edit to make changes.
For instance, by default the stations input file, SPOSNAN is statins.in, but it it should
be different every, just change it to name_in_sta  = stations_#DATE#.in, for instance.
<p>
After creating ocean_a_n0.in, just copy it to ocean_f_n0.in, and change NTIMES to the forecast
days you are interested.

<div class=subtitles>11. model execution options</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
Model can be executed with and without a queuing system. To run without, set name_run in oof.conf
to the model execution command. The executables are linked as roms_a and roms_f (analysis and
forecast) in folder ~/op/oof/run.
<p>
So, if you will run the model locally (ex.: roms_a &lt; roms.in &gt; roms.out) just set
name_run = roms_#FA#. Do the same if you will use a queing system.
<p>
I you will use MPI without queuing system, you can do, for instance:
name_run = /opt/intel/bin/mpirun -np 80 --machinefile machines ./roms_#FA#
(in this case, place the file machines in run folder)
<p>
In oof.conf you must change the flags qsub (for queuing system) and mpi (if qsub is True, mpi
value is not used).
<p>
If you will use a queuing system, a submission script will be created automatically.
The default one is  ~/op/oof/aux/qsub/model.sub. Edit this file changing things like job name,
mpirun flags, and PBS directives. Options between % % will be change automatically using
oof.conf settings:
<pre>
queue_a=longq
ppn_a=48
walltime_a=10:00:00
nodes_a = 2
</pre>
<br>
There are also similar keys for forecast, they just end with _f instead of _a.
Note that ppn_a * nodes_a = ntilei_a * ntilej_a.
You must also set the full path of qsub (just do which qsub) and qdel in oof.conf.
<p>
Note that some files may need to be placed in run folder, like machines and varinfo.dat.

<div class=subtitles>12. test the creation of job submission script</div>

In [1]: from engine import oof
In [2]: oof.gen_sub(date='20130101',FA='a',cf='oof.conf')

<div class=subtitles>13. run first day</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
As a test, you should try to run the model one day. Then if all is working you can start
the automatic mode, ie, the operational system.
<div class=bash>
[user@ ~op/oof]$ ipython
In [1]: from engine import oof
In [2]: oof.run(date='20130101',FA='a',cf='oof.conf')

A sequence of steps starts with some prints in the screen:

<a name='item14'></a>
[<a href='#top'>top</a>]
<div class=subtitles>14. run operationally</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
If the first day test went well, it is time make it run continuously:
<div class=bash>
[user@ ~op/oof]$ ipython
In [1]: from engine import oof
In [2]: oof.oof('oof.conf','plots.conf',FA='a') # FA='f' for forecast
</div>
<br>
The system will search for last date in model outputs and will check model standard output
to see if model ended normally (no blow up). After this, it will check if atm data for
next date is available, a well as lateral boundary data. If is not available it will wait
some mintes and check again and again, for more than one day. Then, after all data is ready,
the system do the run of the next day. After this some default plots may be done, if
plots=True in oof.conf.
<br>
I suggest you to set plots=False at this stage. Plots are created by module engine/op_plot.py
and several plots can be done: slices at several depths; slices with currents; different sizes
for figures; forcing wind; wind-roses; etc. All about plots is configurable in file plots.conf.
<p>
It may take a while before you have good settings for plots, so better let system run without
plots in the mean time. When you decide plots.conf is good enough, set plots=True in oof.conf
and restart oof. If you are inside ipython just do Ctrl+C and call oof.oof(... again.
<p>
Actually the right way to run oof.oof is not from a python session. It should be done with
a script called from crontab. The engine may stop for some reason, so crontab will ensure it
will start automatically. Such script, check_oof.py is available in folder ~/op and it checks
if run_a.py and run_f.py are running. These two call oof.oof(...

<p>
Another way to check if system is running is with ps:
<div class='bash'>
[user@ ~]$ ps -e | grep run
</div>
<p>
This command should list run_a.py and run_f.py. If not go check latest prints, which are stored in
logs folder (~/op/log). Each time system restarts, a new log file is created. It stores all the
messages from the regular execution of the system, as well as error messages.
<p>

About adding check oof to crontab, you may also need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the current value.
Do echo $LD_LYBRARY_PATH; copy the result; edit crontab (crontab -e) and in the first lines add
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;paste&gt;. Then, you may call check_oof.py every 30 mins for instance:
0,30 * * * * python /home/user/op/check_oof.py<br>
If you just want analysis (only run_a.py is to be used) add a after check_oof.py.
</div>
<p>


<a name='item15'></a>
[<a href='#top'>top</a>]
<div class=subtitles>15. plots</div>
<div style='padding-left: 10px'>
If plots=True in oof.conf, after model runs, several plots may be created automatically, and stored
in folder ~/op/oof/outputs/plots. The types of plots, sizes, colormaps, depths, etc, can be
configured in ~/op/oof/plots.conf. The first thing to do is to find a good size for the horizontal
slices (a map projection is used).

<div class=bash>
[user@ ~]$ cd ~/op/oof
[user@ ~/op/oof]$ ipython
In [1]: from engine import op_plot
In [2]: op_plot.plt0('oof.conf','plots.conf')
In [3]: import pylab as pl
In [4]: pl.show()
</div>
<p>
By default the files plt0.png and plt0_thumb.png will be saved in folder ~/op/oof/outputs/plots.
Change the figure size and axes position with option size under [FIGURE] and option position
under [AXES]. The option tag (under [FIGURE] sets the number of figures to create. For instance
to create plt0.png and plt0_thumb.png, tag must be set as tag=;thumb. If it was tag=label1;label2;label3
would be created the files plt0_label1.png, plt0_label2.png, plt0_label3.png. This is useful
to create thumbs for a web visualisation site. Every option can differ among the different tags, the
most obvious is size, but you may don't want to show parallels and meridians in thumbs, for instance.
Just separate the options with ";". If no ";" is found, the first option will be used.
<p>

Now try to plot some slices of daily averaged variables:
<div class=bash>
In [5]: # surface salinity:
In [6]: op_plot.plt_hslice('oof.conf','plots.conf','20130101',var='salt',ind=-1, slice='k')
In [7]: pl.show()
In [8]: # temperature at 1000 m with currents every 7 grid point, with scale 1e-5:
In [9]: op_plot.plt_hslice('oof.conf','plots.conf','20130101',var='temp',ind=-1000,
   ...:                    slice='z',currents=True,dcurr=(7,7),scurr=1e-5)
In [10]: pl.show()
In [11]: # wind:
In [12]: op_plot.plt_wind('oof.conf','plots.conf','20130101')
In [13]: pl.show()
</div>

<p>
There are many options in plots.conf, but in the end the plotting module is simple, easy to edit
and it should be viewed as a starting point. It is quite useful to create all files needed to
display forecasts in the web.
