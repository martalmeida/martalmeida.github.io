The several analysis and plotting desktop environments in use
by the oceanographic community (being Matlab the most widely
used) have proved to be adequate mainly for interactive work and
for setting up seasonal simulations. These environments can be used
for performing some of the tasks required in coastal model forecasts.
However, the use of such tools in routine daily forecasts reveals
the lack of flexibility and optimisation in terms of speed and memory
use, and the nonrobustness for batch mode work.

<p>
The Operational Ocean Forecast Python Engine consists in a set of free,
open-source, portable and fast modules that provide a way to cope with
the demanding requirements of routine execution of a regional ocean
model and that make the forecast process possible and fully automatic
and robust.

<p>
OOF&epsilon; was conceived intending to operate the ocean model
ROMS, but since many others ocean models use similar input/output
schemes and sequences, OOF&epsilon; engine can be adapted to steer the
execution and analysis of other ocean models with little effort.
